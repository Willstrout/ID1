            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><strong>Why did I decide to depart on this crazy path to become a designer?</strong></p>
            <p> I've always been attracted to drawing and creating as a child. I used to draw Dragon Ball Z characters obsessively trying to get every detail right, and I can still remember that first "eureka!" moment when I finally figured out how to really draw what I see, I was probably about age 11. From there everything just compiled, I took art classes in school when I could and kept staying creative and finding more things to do with my passion to bring things to life. I got into a little bit of animation and programming and made a few game prototypes when I was still pretty young, and that's when it really sunk in that people do things like this for a living and it doesn't just have to stay a hobby forever. So I kept at it and after some wavering, I finally chose to start my art degree and try to push forward and make this my full-time
            <p><strong>What do I want to do as a real designer?</strong></p>
            <p>So many things! I'm working on a couple games that I'd like to eventually ship, I'm also putting together an outline for a single issue graphic novel to go with said game, I'd like to do freelance work in web design and other types of design as well. Most of all I'd just really like to find my 'niche' where I can create a fan base and make content that I enjoy because others enjoy it as well, It's a long shot but I think that's my overall end goal, if it be video games or just illustrations I'd like to put it out there and make others as excited about this stuff as I am.</p>
