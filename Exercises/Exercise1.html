        <h1>State of the world.</h1>
        <p><strong><u>What do you love about the world today?</u></strong></p>
        <p>Things I love, well, I love art and how it can make you feel so hopeful for the future or be your best friend when things aren't so great, lately that is what drives me, to try and comunicate whatever I'm feeling that day, however high or low that may be through my art. Because in my opinion, you can have the most polished work out there, with all of the rendering and attention to detail in the world, but if you've got nothing to say or don't know very well how to say it, you're art will not impact anyone in a meaningful way. Also coffee, coffee is nice.</p>
        <p><strong><u>What do you hate about the world today?</u></strong></p>
        <p>Hate is a strong word, but what i dislike about the world is people's refusal of knowledge for fear that it may change their outlook or views even for the better, this can go from any topic from something as heavy as religion or someone complaining about the newest release of photoshop without actually diving in and figuring out why these changes were made, even if it makes their quality of life a little better in the long run. That is truly something I have no paitience for, the refusal to learn and grow.</p>
        <p><strong><u>What would you change?</u></strong></p>
        <p>This is a tough one, because while the world is terribly flawed in many way, it is also equally amazing. So to change one thing i dislike may relust in the destruction of something I love even if they don't seem related at the time. but if i could get people to do something a little more, is to stop, and take in the current moment, smell the flowers and enjoy each moment that you're lucky enough to have.</p>
