        <p><strong><u>What is your favorite band?</u></strong></p>
        <p>Anamanaguchi
	
	 <P>Established in 2004, this electronic band from New York has been wowing fans of both chiptune and rock music by fusing the two together in an awesome celebration of nerd culture. They take elements from classic video games, j-pop, and rock anthems and combine them all into what is a perfect mesh of electronic tones and hard rock instrumentals. Their first big hit was “meow” which was a collaboration between Daniel Gray Longino and Eric Notarnicola from Absolutely productions, the same production company that makes Tim and Eric and has also been mentioned many times to be one of Peter Berkman’s top influences, as well as Japanese music and video games.</P>

     <P>Anamanaguchi also does something very interesting as far as their stage equipment goes, since they are partly a chiptune band, they commonly use old video game hardware to make a large part of the music. Most prominently they use a modified NES (Nintendo entertainment system) as well as a Gameboy, mainly because those make the most iconic sounds that most people think of when they think of video game music from their childhood. This kind of attention to detail is what gives this band such an authentic and immediately relatable sound to people that grew up with video games being a major part of their life.Their love of video games doesn’t stop at just influencing their sound but also has made a career path for them to follow. Ubisoft approached them about making the sound track for the Scott pilgrim Vs. the world video game adaption with the soundtrack later being released on amazon and hitting the 3rd spot on Billboard’s “Heatseekers” chart in 2010. After the success they saw from this they turned to kickstarter to fun their next album named “Endless Fantasy” which was a smash success and in just 11 hours they raised the 50,000 dollars necessary to make the album a reality. The album was quite successful and an immediate fan hit, Entertainment weekly described it as being “glitchy electronic flourishes and relentlessly bubble gummy vibe,” citing similarities to Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, a popular J-pop artist and fashion model that can only be described as a Lisa Frank painting come to life.
         <P>Their next venture took many fans by surprise as they weren’t releasing an album, instead they were releasing 30 new tracks via a video game called Capsule silence, which was an interesting concept in which you unlock songs that you can download and listen to eventually unlocking the whole “album” through subsequent playthroughs. The band also shocked fans with an announcing for their currently in progress album titled “USA” saying that this wasn’t going to be a chiptune album and would be something different from the previous work that they’ve done. This is the reason why I like this band so much is that they’re not afraid to pursue whatever it is that they want to say, even if it’s not quite what they’re known for, they’ll still work extremely hard to make sure that they’re still putting out high quality content that fans should still enjoy.  </P>
