            Established in 2004, this electronic band from New York has been wowing fans of both chiptune and rock music by fusing the two together in an awesome celebration of nerd culture. They take elements from classic video games, j-pop, and rock anthems and combine them all into what is a perfect mesh of electronic tones and hard rock instrumentals. Their first big hit was “meow” which was a
            collaboration between Daniel Gray Longino and Eric Notarnicola from Absolutely productions, the same production company that makes Tim and Eric and has also been mentioned many times to be one of Peter Berkman’s top influences, as well as Japanese music and video games.
