            <li><strong>
                Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes
                </strong></li>
            <p>
                for the title they used a white hand painted typeface similar to their most recent album, and used very effectively over the video background that begins the article. The headers are a very pain san-serif, but clean and make sense for the article, same with paragraphs. The pull quotes are the most interesting here as they're and animated type face where the words change from ones and zeros and back again, this really brings to life the feeling of the band with the high electronic vibes mixed with classic samples, turning things we're familiar with hearing into something new.

            <li><strong>
                Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?
                </strong></li>
            <p>
                They used lots of sky colors in this one, such as blues, tans, and peachy colors, and mostly in gradients to make them look even more "sky-like." 
            </p>
            <li><strong>
                What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?   
                </strong></li>
            <P>
                Tee visuals do the group justice as they use stars for the background to thematically match big album before the article, which was discovery, and the fiery pictures perfectly reflect one of their constant themes from their troma movie and even their new album which was burning away everything they had done to breath new life into music. the visuals are used like in many of these cover stories, to break up the article and make it flow a little better, along with some neat scrolling tricks, such as quotes flying across the screen as you scroll down and pictures of the two members appearing and changing as you continue to scroll.
            </P>
            <li><strong>
                How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?  
                </strong></li>
            <p>
                They were separated by sharp color changes and pictures, you can tell when the breaks are coming as an image will scroll in from the side or a quote may appear, or a sharp horizontal break in the column will happen, as well as a color change. I think they bring a nice flow to the article.
