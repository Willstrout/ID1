        <h1>Exercise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
        <h2><strong>96 Elephants</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I'd descibe this site as grungy but very simple, no scrolling to begin with, just the three chapter choices. and very simple to navigate once you start reading the stories as well.</li>

            <li>To navigate the multi-chapter story you just start at the beginning and croll down until the button for the next chapter is revealed at the very bottom. The way things are arranged you never feel like you don't know what to do next and are able to keep moving at a steady pace.</li>

            <li>The first two chapters focus on what atrocities are happening to elephants and paint a very dismal picture, while chapter 3 acknowledges all of the people that are trying to change the tide and increase populations of elephants and decrease the amount of poachers willing to put up with the danger of poaching for ivory.</li>

            <li>I feel that the creators of this site hoped to pluck at your hearts strings and really make you sympathise for the elephants and feel like there's something you can do to help, before leading you to a donation section where you can contribute to the cause. So in short, awareness and fund raising.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2><strong>Elizabeth River Trial</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I'd use the Adjectives Bright, clean, and friendly to desctibe the sights overall aesthetic.</li>

            <li>The site has four pages, the landing page, explore, History, and Future pages. It's very easy to navigate as the buttons are always visible and there are very few links to click around through.</li>

            <li>The page names seem very appropriate as they go in depth into each of the three topics and at no point leave you wondering as to their point.</li>

            <li>I think the creators wanted people to know about the trail as many people, even those that live quite close to norfolk, may not know about it at all. They also want people to know what they can do in terms of help if they've used and enjoyed the trail and want to ensure its sustainability.</li>
