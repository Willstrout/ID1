            <!-- Question 1-->
            <li><strong>
                Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.
                </strong></li>
            <P>The fonts on this site read like a paperback book, very smooth and not overstated, much like the music. for the body the letters are small and crowded but not difficult to read,</P>
            <li><strong>
                <!-- Question 2-->
                What are the visual cues?
                </strong></li>
            <p>there are breaks with really long scroll times that make letters face or a background slowly bcome engulfed by a picture or wall of text, making you feel liek you should take things in slowly, much like the way their slow methodical beats give you a sense of calm and let you really absorb the lyrics</p>
            <li><strong>
                <!-- Question 3-->
                How are sections separated?
                </strong></li>
            <p>Mostly with pictures but also large, boxed in pull quotes.</p>
            <!-- Question 4-->
            <li><strong>
                Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?
                </strong></li>
            <P>The pallette is mostly a pinkinsh gray, with black letters, and bergundy backgrounds in a couple spots.</P>
            <!-- Question 4-->
            <li><strong>
                What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?
                </strong></li>
            <p>The visuals serve to reflect the meloncholy nature of their music and really give you a sense of how interacting with the group memebers may actually be. with the contrast between the super serious and some funny pictures gives me the feeling that the represent very well how the front man's personality is.</p>
