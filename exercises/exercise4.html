            <li><strong>
                Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes
                </strong></li>
            <p>
                The title of this article is done in a colorful handwritten looking font that continues for the pull quotes, just with the colors dropped. like many of the other articles the subheads are simple san serif fonts that are informal and easily understood. The body text is also an easily read serif font.

            </p>
            <li><strong>
                Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?
                </strong></li>
            <p>
                There are so many colors here! in the title, the backgrounds, the clouds, everything, it gives the whole article a really lighthearted and fantasy type feel. I like the fonts were mostly black though, as to not get any crazier.
            </p>
            <li><strong>
                What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?   
                </strong></li>
            <P>
                They serve the amuse and give you an insight into the playful nature of the group and their music, the kaleidoscope style pictures as well as the multicolored nature of the whole assembly gives it a pretty "trippy" feel.
            </P>
            <li><strong>
                How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?  
                </strong></li>
            <p>
                Sections are separated by abruptly ending the colorful and animated backgrounds that the text emerges from and introducing a funky picture with a pull quote that appears and disappears, followed by the next colorful background and more text.
