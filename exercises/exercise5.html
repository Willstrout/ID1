            <h3>Desktop</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjectives I would use are: Informal, silly, clean, utilitarian, and eyecatching</li>
                
                <li>The navigation of the site is very simple and clean, with not too many buttons or animations to get in the way, but just enough to get you where you need to go without so many extra clicks or drop down menus. I especially like the transparent top bar that stays with the same few buttons while you scroll that way you can move right to the next item when you're done reading the current page.</li>
                
                <li>I'd say that the introductory information is very short and sweet. I learned quite a bit about her from the short block of text, her current occupation, where she went to school, what publications and projects she's worked for/on and even a glance into her sense of humor which is pretty nice because you can tell that she had fun putting this together and can assume that carries over into her paid work.</li>
                
                <li>The layout seems pretty interesting, with a HUGE red headline to make sure you don't click away after loading the page, followed by a pretty short and easy to read section outlining her professional history without going into too much detail, which is nice. It then breaks down into a more personal "about me" section and even a PDF of her resume if you'd like more specific information. She even includes a form that you can use to contact her if the page didn't have the info you were looking for. The red button reading "send away" is a nice touch as well.</li>
                
                <li>her footer is very simple with very subtle gray icon links to her twitter and instagram and a couple other pages, it even has the icons change color or animate when you roll over them.</li>
            </ol>
                <section>
                    <h3>mobile</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>With mobile, the navigation of the website changes by hiding the title of the site and only leaving the little icon that you can click to go back to her main page and it hides the links that were at the top by now putting them behind a hamburger button that reveals the options after a press with a neat little animation turning that same button into an X when you're done looking through the list.</li>
                        
                        <li>The headline text gets narrower to fit onto the phone screen and the font size itself gets a little smaller so that it's not taking such a large chunk of your screen as well.</li>
                        
                        <li>The body text stays relatively the same font size but narrows like the headline to fit onscreen without having to scroll left or right.</li>
                        
                        <li>The layout of the content overall becomes more vertical with each different section showing up right under the previous instead of being laid out side by side.</li>
                        
                        <li>The footer of the page also becomes vertical, stacking everything on top of each other rather than being spread out wide along a bigger, wider screen.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>Desktop</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>I would use the Adjectives: Compartmentalized, colorful, lighthearted, informative.</li>
                    
                    <li>In her into, you learn that she's a very busy person, with both full-time and freelance work, and you also learn that she works with startups and lists that she's currently working with Sennep and Burberry, she dabbles in brand identity but is most comfortable digging into front end code.</li>
                    
                    <li>They way her portfolio entries are put together is all through one scrolling list of images and information, each section being broken by a white line followed by an image. The project descriptions are entered in after the first image and are arranged in two columns, one with the title and one with the project contents. After the description she has the actual project samples laid out in a grid with two side by side images showing off many different aspects of each project.</li>
                    
                    <li> The footer is just very simple text links to email, phone, twitter, etc. with no images at all.</li>
                </ol>
                <section>
                    <h3>Mobile</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In the mobile version, instead of starting with a large image you just get the text, nice and big so you can read it, but I feel it loses a little personality.</li>
                        <li>The start to each individual section also changes, much like he opening they lose their colorful pictures and now you just see the white text, telling you the title of each project before going into a text description, which is now laid out vertically instead of side by side like on the desktop version of the page. The project images have also now been lined up so that you may scroll through them, the only trouble being is that's all the interaction you get, making the images very difficult to read and kind of off-putting, but I suppose you still get a feel for the sites but not in the same way you would browsing on desktop.</li>

                    <h3>Desktop + Mobile</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>With the Desktop site, the layout is extremely simple with his bio, contact info, and specialties listed on the left. TO the right of those he has his projects all listed, at first glance this website looks like it isn't complete, but once you scroll over the project links, the whole site comes to life with the logos popping up on the far right and the whole page itself changing colors to match each project.</li>
                        <li>The hierarchy of the site is determined by space and arrangement, with everything typed out in the same size text but it has huge breaks in between each section so that you kind of get a feel for how you should read it.</li>
                        
                        <li>On mobile, the website goes completely vertical, much like the other sites we've looked at earlier. It just now places his projects under the other info and since most phones don't have a hover feature, you don't see the colors or anything until you tap on each project, then you're taken to the project page where the color shows up slowly as you scroll, which is a very nice touch.</li>
                        
                        <li>The text size on the site doesn't seem to change too much, maybe it's a little bigger? but it's hard to tell, but it is very readable.</li>
                    </ol>
